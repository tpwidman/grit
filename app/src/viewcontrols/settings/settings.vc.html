		<h1>About GRIT</h1>
        <p>When we set out to develop our first app, we wanted to make something useful and improve upon what others have already done. We also sought to test the skills we developed over the course of Birmingham's first software development bootcamp, Depot/U.</p>
        <p>We wanted to incorporate an efficient, stream-lined task manager with the highly-successful Pomodoro Technique, which at its very nature requires determination and "grit" to use effectively. By focusing in set intervals (typically 25 minutes) with minor breaks in between, many have achieved the same levels of productivity as a 40-hour work week in less than 20 hours. </p>
        <p>We wanted to make this technique as accessible and user-friendly as possible so that anyone could learn - and use - this technique while also managing any task they set out to achieve.</p>
        <p>Let's get gritty.</p>
